# GAMA (Geometric Assessment & Market Analysis)

## üü¢ Getting Started for New Users

Welcome to GAMA! This project is designed for maximum automation and user-friendliness. Follow these steps for a seamless onboarding experience:

1. **Clone & Set Up**
   - Follow the instructions below to clone the repo and set up your `.env` file.

2. **Unified Automation CLI**
   - Discover and run all automation, ETL, and validation scripts with a single command:
     ```sh
     npm run cli
     # or
     yarn cli
     # or
     npx ts-node ./scripts/cli.ts
     ```
   - You'll get an interactive menu of available scripts. Each script provides its own help/usage info with `--help`.

3. **Script Help & Troubleshooting**
   - Run any script with `--help` for usage guidance and options.
   - All scripts support interactive prompts and clear error messages.
   - For detailed script documentation, see [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## üöÄ Deployment & CI/CD

TerraFusionTheory supports automated deployment on both Linux/macOS and Windows, as well as continuous deployment via GitHub Actions.

### Deploy on Linux/macOS
Run the Bash deployment script:
```sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```
This script builds Docker images, starts services, runs migrations, initializes agents, and verifies healthchecks. Customize as needed for your environment.

### Deploy on Windows
Run the batch deployment script:
```bat
scripts\deploy.bat
```
This script installs dependencies, builds the project, and provides a template for custom deployment steps (e.g., file copy, remote deploy).

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
- On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions will:
  - Lint, test, and build the project
  - Run deployment automation via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Configure your deployment secrets (e.g., `DEPLOY_KEY`) in your repository settings.

See [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md) for more automation details.
