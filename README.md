- **Valuation Benchmarking**: Evaluates valuation accuracy against market standards
- **DriftGuard Operator**: Kubernetes operator for configuration integrity management

### 3. Spatial Analytics Components

Advanced spatial analysis tools for property valuation:

- R-tree spatial indexing for efficient spatial queries
- Feature engineering for spatial variables
- Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling
- Quantile Gradient Boosting predictive models
- SHAP value analysis for model interpretation

## Deployment & CI/CD

The platform includes a complete CI/CD pipeline for enterprise deployment:
