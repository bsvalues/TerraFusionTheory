**"Replit AI Agent, please continue to refine the BS Intelligent Agent with the following objectives:

1. Enhance Performance & Responsiveness:

Optimize UI rendering to ensure smooth performance even with high volumes of data. Implement lazy loading or virtualization techniques for large arrays.
Monitor and log API call latencies to identify and address any bottlenecks.
2. Expand Error Handling & User Feedback:

Develop a dedicated error dashboard that aggregates and displays real-time error messages and logs, particularly for issues related to data parsing and API interactions.
Integrate an in-app feedback form on the dashboard, allowing users to report issues or suggest improvements.
3. Strengthen Testing & CI/CD Processes:

Expand unit and integration tests for the useProject and useConversation hooks as well as for all UI components, ensuring robust error handling and performance.
Enhance the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run these tests on every commit and deploy to a staging environment.
4. Ensure Scalability & Dynamic Data Integration:

Implement real-time data update mechanisms (e.g., via WebSockets) so that changes in the backend data are immediately reflected in the UI.
Integrate with the DataSourceBridge module if applicable, to support centralized and dynamic data ingestion.
5. Update Documentation & User Training:

Update the applicationâ€™s documentation to reflect recent changes in data parsing, validation, and UI rendering.
Create interactive tutorials or video walkthroughs that demonstrate how the BS Intelligent Agent displays project information, handles conversations, and presents analysis data.
Deliverable: A fully optimized BS Intelligent Agent that maintains high performance and responsiveness, robust error handling with real-time logging, comprehensive automated tests within the CI/CD pipeline, and clear, updated documentation with interactive training materials. Please confirm if further clarification is needed, or begin executing these enhancements."**
