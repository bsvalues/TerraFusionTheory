### **Targeted Replit Agent Prompt: Integrate MCP**

> **Task:**  
> Enhance our Replit AI Agent by integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable standardized, context-rich data retrieval from various data sources.  
> 
> **Objectives:**  
> - Allow the agent to automatically retrieve additional context via MCP endpoints, enhancing its ability to answer queries accurately.  
> - Create an MCP connector module in our agent tools that standardizes data fetching from different sources.
> - Update the agent core to incorporate this context into its memory and response generation.
> 
> **Implementation Steps:**  
> 1. **Create MCP Connector:**  
>    - Develop a new module (e.g., `agent/tools/mcp.py`) that implements functions for connecting to MCP endpoints, handling authentication if required, and standardizing the response.  
>    - Ensure the MCP module is designed to fetch additional context data that can be merged with the agent's current memory.
> 
> 2. **Integrate MCP in Agent Core:**  
>    - Update `agent/core.py` to load the MCP connector as one of the available tools.  
>    - Modify the `run(query)` method to first retrieve context via the MCP connector before or after querying local memory.  
>    - Merge the MCP context data with the agent’s own memory context for enriched responses.
> 
> 3. **Configuration:**  
>    - Update environment variables or configuration files (e.g., `.env` or `config/settings.py`) to store MCP endpoint URLs, API keys, or other necessary configuration details.
> 
> 4. **Testing:**  
>    - Implement unit tests (in `tests/test_mcp.py`) to verify that the MCP connector correctly fetches and returns context data.
>    - Extend the end-to-end tests to ensure that the complete system now includes MCP-sourced context in its responses.
> 
> **Expected Outcome:**  
> The Replit AI Agent will now leverage MCP to access standardized context from diverse data sources, enhancing its responses with richer, more accurate data insights.
>

### **Generic Implementation Plan**

1. **Develop MCP Connector Module:**

   Create a new file at `agent/tools/mcp.py` with content similar to:
   ```python
   import requests

   class MCPConnector:
       def __init__(self, endpoint, api_key=None):
           self.endpoint = endpoint
           self.api_key = api_key

       def fetch_context(self, query):
           headers = {}
           if self.api_key:
               headers['Authorization'] = f"Bearer {self.api_key}"
           payload = {'query': query}
           try:
               response = requests.post(self.endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
               response.raise_for_status()
               return response.json()  # Assuming a JSON response containing context data.
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Error fetching MCP context: {e}")
               return None

   # Convenience function
   def get_mcp_context(query, endpoint, api_key=None):
       connector = MCPConnector(endpoint, api_key)
       return connector.fetch_context(query)
   ```

2. **Update Agent Core:**

   In `agent/core.py`, import and use the MCP connector:
   ```python
   import importlib
   from agent.memory.vector import VectorMemory
   from agent.tools import web, file
   from agent.tools.mcp import get_mcp_context
   import os

   class ReplitAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.memory = VectorMemory()
           # Load tools dynamically
           self.tools = self.load_tools()
           # Load MCP configuration from environment variables
           self.mcp_endpoint = os.getenv("MCP_ENDPOINT", "https://mcp.example.com/api/context")
           self.mcp_api_key = os.getenv("MCP_API_KEY")
           print("✅ AI Agent Initialized with MCP support")

       def load_tools(self):
           tool_names = ["web", "file", "mcp"]
           return [importlib.import_module(f"agent.tools.{tool}") for tool in tool_names if tool != "mcp"]

       def run(self, query):
           # Retrieve local memory context
           local_context = self.memory.retrieve(query)
           # Retrieve additional context using MCP
           mcp_context = get_mcp_context(query, self.mcp_endpoint, self.mcp_api_key)
           # Combine both contexts
           combined_context = f"Local Context: {local_context}\nMCP Context: {mcp_context}"
           response = f"Agent Response based on combined context:\n{combined_context}"
           return response
   ```

3. **Configuration:**

   Update your `.env` or configuration file with:
   ```env
   MCP_ENDPOINT=https://mcp.example.com/api/context
   MCP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Testing:**

   Add unit tests in `tests/test_mcp.py` to ensure the MCP connector works as expected:
   ```python
   from agent.tools.mcp import MCPConnector

   def test_mcp_connector():
       # Use a mock endpoint or a known test endpoint for MCP
       connector = MCPConnector("https://mcp.example.com/api/context", api_key="test_key")
       result = connector.fetch_context("sample query")
       assert result is not None, "MCP context should not be None"
   ```

5. **Integrate into CI/CD:**

   Make sure to add these new tests to your CI pipeline so that any changes to the MCP integration are automatically verified.
