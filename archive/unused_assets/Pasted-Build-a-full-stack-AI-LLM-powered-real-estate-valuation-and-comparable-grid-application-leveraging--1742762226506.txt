Build a full-stack, AI LLM-powered real estate valuation and comparable grid application leveraging actual live data connections. Your implementation should include:

### Dynamic Roadmap & Progress Tracking
- Implement an interactive Kanban board integrated directly with Jira to visualize progress and tasks.
- Track real-time milestone completion against actual live SQL database updates and deployments.

### Modular File and Folder Structure
- Use the predefined folder structure with specific modules for residential, commercial, and land valuations.
- Dedicated sub-modules for data ingestion, comparable grid processing, valuation scoring algorithms, and dynamic data management.

### Secure Live Data Connection & Integration
- Set up secure, encrypted connections to your live SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL), strictly avoiding any demo data.
- Implement real-time data fetch, caching strategies, and error handling for continuous, robust connectivity.
- Integrate ORM layers or direct SQL connections based on optimal performance metrics.

### Intelligent Troubleshooting with Continuous Testing
- Automated data quality checks against actual data constraints to proactively detect issues.
- AI-driven debugging mechanism utilizing historical logs from real database interactions to suggest solutions for common and uncommon data anomalies.

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Detailed OpenAPI documentation for APIs directly linked to actual database schemas.
- Real-time generated documentation reflecting database schema changes, including ER diagrams.
- Developer handbook covering real-data handling protocols, troubleshooting guides, and data-integrity maintenance.

### Modular Plug-and-Play Architecture
- Clear, standardized interfaces for integrating new property data streams or valuation modules dynamically.
- Plugin manager to support the seamless integration or removal of data-driven valuation methodologies.

### AI & LLM Agent Playground
- A streamlined playground integrated with your real data environment for accurate model experimentation.
- Utilize scikit-learn for rapid experimentation with valuation models.
- Employ Dask for scalable parallel processing of large real estate datasets.
- Integrate Ray for efficient distributed execution and hyperparameter tuning.
- Implement MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking, version control, and comparison of valuation model performance.
- Leverage PyCaret for rapid prototyping, comparison, and visualization of different valuation models.
- Use matplotlib-venn for clear visualization of intersections and overlaps between model predictions.
- Vector database integration for advanced semantic search across historical real-world appraisal data.

### Packaged Deployment
- Production-grade Dockerfiles and Helm charts for deploying to cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), hybrid, or on-premise infrastructures.
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous delivery integrated directly with your live database schema updates.
- Always utilize GitHub open-source solutions when available to enhance transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

### AI-driven Continuous Feedback & Learning
- Implement adaptive learning mechanisms using user feedback collected from real property valuation outcomes.
- Continuous retraining pipelines triggered by data drift or changes detected in your production database environment.

Ensure compliance with data privacy and industry standards, utilizing actual operational data securely and effectively at every stage.
