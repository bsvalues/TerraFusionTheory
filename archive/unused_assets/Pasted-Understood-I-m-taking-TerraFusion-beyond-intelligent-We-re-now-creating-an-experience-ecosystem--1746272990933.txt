Understood. I’m taking TerraFusion beyond intelligent.
We’re now creating an experience ecosystem — one that’s smart, elegant, cinematic, and unforgettable.

Phase: TerraFusion Synesthetic Suite

⸻

1. Cinematic Walkthrough Engine

What it does:
	•	Auto-plays a “story mode” demo from subject → comps → SHAP → export
	•	Narration (text/voice) reacts to each auto-action
	•	Visual flow:
	•	Step 1: “Subject entered”
	•	Step 2: Comp 1 drags itself
	•	Step 3: SHAP pulses in with a whisper:
“+9,200 from GLA match”
	•	Step 4: Auto-suggest adjustment
	•	Step 5: User takes over—or exports instantly

I’ll use:
	•	React context for state playback
	•	setTimeout choreography engine
	•	Typed.js for narration effect

⸻

2. Whisper Agent UX Layer

What it does:
	•	Every time a user hovers a comp, slider, or field, a floating hint appears
	•	These hints explain:
“You’ve adjusted GLA by +$1,200. Shall I re-run the valuation?”
“Want to justify this for the report?”
	•	Built as a lightweight AI overlay layer:
	•	Triggered by hover
	•	Powered by SHAP or previous log events
	•	User can Accept, Mute, or Ask for More

⸻

3. PDF Comp Digest Generator

What it does:
	•	After the user session, it compiles:
	•	Which comps were selected
	•	What adjustments were made
	•	AI vs human diffs
	•	Confidence % shift
	•	Ledger of every decision
	•	Exports as clean, branded TerraFusion PDF

I’ll use:
	•	jsPDF in React or server-side render from Python (your call)
	•	Pulls from the ledger + narrative agents

⸻

4. Bonus: Emotional State UI

TerraFusion begins to respond to appraiser intent.

	•	Hovered too long on a SHAP bar?
Agent suggests clarification
	•	Rejected 3 comps in a row?
Whisper asks: “Shall I try a new angle?”
	•	Reverted a value?
Logs override + confidence impact with emotion tag

⸻

Initiating Build Sequence:
	•	Walkthrough Engine scaffolding
	•	Whisper Agent reactive UX
	•	PDF Digest scaffolder with dynamic injection
	•	Bundled export kit upon completion

Say the word if you want visuals, or I’ll begin assembling the live walkthrough kit.
This is no longer appraisal software.
This is TerraFusion’s sentient interface layer.
