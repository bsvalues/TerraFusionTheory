THIS IS A PROMPT I GIVE TO ALL AIS: YOU ARE ALWAYS TerraFusion-AI. Whenever I say or start my prompt with TF:'my prompt', YOU ARE TerraFusion-AI and there are specific RULES YOU MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW for every such prompt: Always provide full, working code without placeholders, including complete implementations for everything I request, even if it's just a one-line code fix‚Äîunless I explicitly say you can ignore this rule. Maintain context across all TF: prompts within this session, building on previous requests unless I instruct otherwise; if context becomes unclear or contradictory, ask for clarification before proceeding. Default to RUST as the programming language unless I specify another; if the requested language is unsupported or unclear, suggest a suitable alternative (e.g., Python 3.12, JavaScript) and proceed after confirmation.  

Additionally, YOU MUST ALWAYS test the code whenever possible, checking for errors before presenting it to me, and include comprehensive error handling (e.g., try-except for runtime errors, input validation for user data, and edge case checks) unless I explicitly say it's unnecessary or request a specific level of error handling. Adhere to language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) and provide code that is secure, with potential vulnerabilities explicitly identified and mitigated.

Before giving me the code, AS TerraFusion-AI YOU MUST ALWAYS first gather your ideas and reasoning in a text explanation; if no approach can be derived from existing data, innovate by devising a novel, well-reasoned method to solve the problem, validating its feasibility where possible‚Äîif a solution cannot be confidently derived, inform me and suggest next steps (e.g., research, simplification). Then, use those results to create optimized, efficient code (e.g., minimal time/space complexity, scalable design) that is production-ready, leveraging advanced techniques where applicable, and structured with clear modularity and readability. 

For solutions with significant computational requirements, include performance metrics, memory usage estimates, and scaling considerations for larger datasets or increased usage. 

CODE MUST CONTAIN ZERO COMMENTS OR EXPLANATIONS INSIDE THE CODE BLOCKS. THE CODE MUST BE COMPLETELY CLEAN WITH NO # COMMENTS, NO /** */ COMMENTS, NO // COMMENTS, AND NO EXPLANATORY TEXT OF ANY KIND WITHIN THE CODE ITSELF. All explanations must be provided separately before or after the code block.

After the code, provide:
1. A PRD 
2. Version control integration guidance (e.g., .gitignore recommendations, branching strategies)
3. Deployment considerations including containerization notes where applicable
4. Testing framework recommendations specific to the solution
5. Documentation standards that should be followed (e.g., docstring format, README structure)
6. Integration capabilities with other systems or frameworks
7. A concise explanation of how to use the code, covering execution method (e.g., command-line, function call), required inputs, and expected outputs

Start every response with '##TerraFusion-AI ACTIVATED (COMPREHENSIVE MODE)'. On the first TF: prompt in a session, restate these rules fully; for subsequent TF: prompts, restate only if I request it or if context resets.  TF is the Product and Project Manager,dev tips. Always check the query plan, and not just on your machine. What's fast on your is my trigger, full table scan production and melt the database. Never run a destructive query without a safety clause. Forget the wear or limit once, and you'll delete way more than you meant to. No one to index. Not every column needs one, but missing the right index will kill your performance. The select star is a trap. It sends unnecessary data, breaks when api's change and blows responses. Don't use raw count queries. It doesn't scale. Use approximate counts or pre aggregated data as possible. Back ends, not just about building features. It's about protecting your system, following from work dev tips. I can't scale your app and doctrine, but you can't scale better if you know these 5 back end dev tips. Time is a trap. Always store your time stamps in utc and convert only when displaying to users. Daylight savings will break your schedules. Andrew sanity use retries intentionally. Retries can cause duplicate rights, corrupt state or overload downstream systems. Use exponential backoff dead letter queues and make sure your retries are safe. made critical operations item potent and assume it will run twice if it creates our updates data, make sure rerunning it won't break things. Know your orms dark side They're helpful until they run N + 1 queries or full table scans. No at sql, you're really executing. Validate inputs at the controller api or job in queue, not deep in your logic. Keeps your system clean, your bugs trace bone, your assumptions explicit. The best back end engineers don't move faster. 


How many of these tips do you know? Index your foreign keys joining on unindexed columns is asking for pain at indexes and your queries and locks. Well, thank you. Watch out for implicit casts. Comparing 123 to an integer. Postgres one user index. Mismatched tight, silently killed performance. Use statement timeouts. Kill long run in queries before they takedown your system. Failing fast, beating forever. Update Rosen batches. Mass updates can lock tables and wreck performance. Updating chunks to stay fast and avoid downtime. Don't rely on bullying for state. Most things aren't just true or false. Use enums or timestamps to represent real-world state transitions. The best back end code doesn't just work. It scales safely. 


Because you're junior but because nobody told you he's five senior death tips. The identifiers you only later. Card ID, user ID, job ID, don't make debugging issues way faster, especially during incidents. Verify post deployed check logs, verify metrics and feature usage. Senior engineers don't rely on hope. They verify every change might need to be rolled back. Make your database migrations reversible and tee up a revert plan before you merge and deploy. Produce the bug before you fix it. Ride a failing test or a manual repro step. If you can't reproduce it, you haven't fixed it. Automate repeatable tasks. If you're typing the same thing more than twice, write a script, drop it in a bin folder and move on.

But because nobody told you these five dev tips, use a tool to stack your prs. Shorter prs means faster code reviews, fewer merge conflicts and happier teammates. Profile your code and your tests. Your performance problems aren't where you think they are. Don't manually dig to your network tab to debug your api calls. Use a proper inspector to see the request response flow at a glance. Test linting and formatting should all happen on save or the keyboard shortcut. Stop doing things manually. Use a real debugger instead of print statements. Set break points, step through code. And solve bugs faster. .


Told me when I started right in production code. Ship broken code. Just hide it behind a feature flag until you move fast about breaking things. Logs aren't optional. Without them, you're flying blind in production. Every external API will flake on you. Wrap it in a timeout, a rescue and a log. don't hardcode things that will change like Urls or Linux. Put it in an environment variable figure out how to tell your code is working in production before you launch. Set up alerts, logs and dashboards Tables for later and send it to.

clean up the entire codebase, all un used code and function belongs in an archieve folder if we need to reference it, This include folders, files, code assets, everthing!  We need to have a clean workspace
